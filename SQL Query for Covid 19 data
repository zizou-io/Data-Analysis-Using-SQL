--2. PERCENTITLES AND FREQUENCY
--Percentiles : One hundreds equal groups; population divided across group
--Percentiles help us understand the distribution of data by grouping values into equal sized buckets.

--Discrete Percentile: returns value that exists in the column.
--Discrete Percentile is very useful when you want to know the value in the column, that falls into a percentile.

--Continuous Percentile: interpolates the boundary value between the percentiles.
--Continuous Percentile is very useful when you want to know what is the value at the boundary between two percentile buckets.

--TOP 5

it seems like top cases are coming from 12 month, which is not suprising due to seasonality trend of holidays or regions*/

- Are there many days with high cases? 
- or our cases evenly distributed across all days?
