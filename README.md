## SQL Data Analysis Project: COVID-19 Dataset

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed a COVID-19 dataset using SQL to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus. The dataset contains information such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and geographical data.

### Data Cleaning
I began by checking for missing values and updating them to ensure the data was complete and accurate. I also performed basic cleaning operations such as removing unwanted columns and correcting mis-spelled city names.

### Descriptive Statistics
I conducted an exploratory analysis to understand the basic statistics of the dataset. This included calculating the total, minimum, maximum, and average values of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries per month. I also analyzed the distribution of cases across different countries and cities.

### Central Tendency
To understand the central tendency of the data, I calculated the mean, mode, and median of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. This helped me identify the typical values and trends in the dataset.

### Dispersion
I analyzed the dispersion of the data by calculating the range, variance, and standard deviation of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. This provided insights into how spread out the data points were from the mean.

### Percentiles and Frequency
I used percentiles to divide the data into equal-sized buckets and understand the distribution of values. This helped me identify the most common values and the spread of the data.

### Correlation and Ranks
I analyzed the correlation between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries to understand the relationships between these variables. This helped me identify patterns and trends in the data.

### Linear Models
Finally, I used linear regression to estimate the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths. This helped me understand how changes in confirmed cases affected the number of deaths.

### Conclusion
Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the COVID-19 dataset, helping us understand the spread and impact of the virus. These insights can be used to inform public health policies and interventions.
